# latin-app
Latin app made by passing prompts from one chatbot to the next. Ask question "how would I create an app for learning latin with comprehensible input" on perplexity -> export pdf -> chatgpt -> grok -> claude -> gemini -> perplexity -> export pdf -> chatgpt. then write/code prompting in chatgpt to finish off.

most of the chatbots were confused and just restated what was given to them with a different framing. Chatgpt removed a lot of information from its perplexity input (as it usually does, at least on free tier)
